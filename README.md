# Azure Samples for Containers

A collection of samples demonstrating how to deploy cloud native applications on azure.

## 1. Build and Containerize your application

In this lab we will build a sample Go web application locally as a binary. We will then build the Go application using Docker's multi-stage build capabilities using Azure Container Registry Build. 

[Go to lab](1-app-hello-echo/README.md) | Duration: 5-10 minutes

## 2. Deploy your container to Azure

In this lab we will deploy our Go web application, in a container, to [Azure Container Instance and Azure Kubernetes Service](2-1-azure-aci-aks.md). There is also the option to deploy to Azure Web App for Containers or Azure Web App.

[Go to lab](2-azure-containers/2-1-azure-aci-aks.md) | Duration: 10-15 minutes
